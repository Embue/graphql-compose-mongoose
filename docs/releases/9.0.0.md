## What's new?

### 🛑 resolver creation (factory)

- Refactor resolver creation #263
- Expose `mongooseResolvers` for manual creation of resolvers #274
- feat: expose `resolverFactory` for manual resolver creation, eg. for cloned types: `resolverFactory.findMany(UserModel, ClonedUserTC, opts)` – it generates Resolver's types according to `ClonedUserTC` type and will use mongoose `UserModel` for making requests to DB
- feat: added new function `composeMongoose` which generates TypeComposer without resolvers. Now Resolvers can be generated on-demand in such way `PostTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany()` (before was `PostTC.getResolver('findMany')`)
- Improve Typescript definitions for resolvers

### Mutations got `error: ErrorInterface` field in theirs payload for better error handling

All mutation resolvers got `error` field in their payloads. And now clients may choose between two variants how they may receive a runtime resolver error if it happens.

1) First variant, as usual, via `errors` field in the response payload. Assume the following mutation produce runtime error:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
  }
}
```

So you will receive such response from the GraphQL server:

```js
{
  data: { userCreate: null },
  errors: [{
    message: 'E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.users index: email_1',
    extensions: { ... },
    path: ['userCreate'],
  }],
}
```

2) And the second new variant of obtaining errors is – the `error` field in mutation payload:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In such case, you will get the error in `userCreate.error` field and the top-level `errors` field will be undefined:

```js
{
  data: {
    userCreate: {
      error: {
        message: 'E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.users index: email_1',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Moreover `userCreate.error` field is typed and may provide additional information for you. Let's take a look at the implementation of `error` field via SDL, which has some essential comments with technical explanations:

```graphql
type UserCreatePayload {
  recordId: Int
  # First of all the `error` field is described by Interface
  error: ErrorInterface
}

# Describing `UserCreatePayload.error` field by interface
# provides the following advantages:
# - you may return different types of errors with additional fields
# - no matter what type of error is, you may request `message` field anyway
interface ErrorInterface {
  message: String
}

# For now in graphql-compose-mongoose exist 3 error types -
# MongoError, ValidationError & RuntimeError

# MongoError is used if error was thrown from Database
# and contains additional `code` field
type MongoError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  code: Int
}

# ValidationError is used if error was thrown by Mongoose
# when you create or update some documents.
type ValidationError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  errors: ValidatorError
}

# RuntimeError is used as a fallback type if no one of the previous error was met.
type RuntimeError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
}
```

So if clients need more details about mutation errors they able to write the following query:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
    error {
      message
      __typename
      ... on MongoError {
        code
      }
      ... on ValidationError {
        errors {
          message
          path
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Quite long discussion about `error` implementation can be found in [issue #248](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/248)

### Added a new `ValidationError`

Resolvers `createOne`, `createMany`, `updateOne`, `updateById` now returns validator errors in the following shape:

```graphql
type ValidationError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  errors: ValidatorError
}

type ValidatorError {
  message: String
  path: String
  value: JSON
  idx: Int!
}
```

So for such query:

```graphql
mutation {
  createMany(
    records: [
      { name: "Ok" },
      { name: "John", someStrangeField: "Test" }
    ]
  ) {
    records {
      name
    }
    error {
      __typename
      message
      ... on ValidationError {
        errors {
          message
          path
          value
          idx
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You will receive the following response:

```js
{
  data: {
    createMany: {
      records: null,
      error: {
        __typename: 'ValidationError',
        message: 'Nothing has been saved. Some documents contain validation errors',
        errors: [
          {
            message: 'this is a validate message',
            path: 'someStrangeField',
            value: 'Test',
            idx: 1, // <-- points that the second document has error
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

[Issue #248](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/248)

## Improvements

### Now `_id` field can be of any type (Int, String, Object)

Before v9.0.0 was supported only `MongoID` type for `_id` field. Now, it can be of any type – Int, String, Object. For using this feature, you need to add `_id` field to mongoose schema with the desired type, and graphql-compose-mongoose will do the rest:

```ts
const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: { type: Number },
  title: { type: String },
});

interface IBook extends Document {
  _id: number;
  title?: string;
}

const BookModel = mongoose.model<IBook>('Book', BookSchema);
const BookTC = composeMongoose(BookModel);
```

Notes:

- If you choose type `Number` for `_id` field then `graphql-compose-mongoose` will cast it to `Int` GraphQL type. For other fields `Number` is casted to `Float` by default. Anyway you able change type manually – `BookTC.extendField('_id', { type: 'Float!' })`.
- Be careful: Mongoose will refuse to save a document that doesn't have an `_id`. So you're responsible for setting `_id` if you define your own `_id` path. For automatic numeric id creation you can use the following plugins [mongoose-plugin-autoinc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-plugin-autoinc) or [@typegoose/auto-increment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typegoose/auto-increment).

[Issue #141](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/141)

### Add nested fields support, new operators `regex`, `exists` for `filter._operators`

Resolvers which have `filter` arg have `_operators` field, which allows you to write complex filtering logic with `AND`, `OR`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `ne`, `in`, `nin` operators. And in v9.0.0 were added `exists` & `regex`.
Also were added support for nested fields like in `contacts.email` and `contacts.skype`:

```graphql
query {
  findUsers(
    filter: {
      _operators: {
        age: { gt: 10, lt: 20 },
        address: { country: { in: ["US"] } },
        contacts: {
          email: { regex: "/3.COM/i" },
          skype: { exists: true },
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    _id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

By default, for performance reason, `graphql-compose-mongoose` generates operators *only for indexed* fields. BUT you may enable operators for all fields when creating resolver in the following way:

```ts
const userFindMany = UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({
  filter: {
    // enables all operators for all fields
    operators: true,
  }
)};
```

OR provide more granular operators configuration for your needs:

```ts
const userFindMany2 = UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({
  filter: {
    // more granular operators configuration
    operators: {
      // for `age` field add just 3 operators
      age: ['in', 'gt', 'lt'],
      // for non-indexed `amount` field add all operators
      amount: true,
      // don't add this field to operators
      indexedField: false,
    },
  },
  // add suffix for avoiding type names collision with resolver above
  suffix: 'AnotherFindMany',
)};
```

[Issue #250](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/250)

### Better alias support for nested embedded fields

Mongoose support [aliases](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#aliases) for fields. You may have short field names in DB `t`, `a` but they will be present in your models and graphql types under the full names – `title`, `author`:

```ts
const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: { type: Number },
  t: { type: String, alias: 'title' },
  a: { type: AuthorSchema, alias: 'author' },
  meta: {
    v: { type: Number, alias: 'votes' },
    f: { type: Number, alias: 'favs' },
  }
});
```

From the example above, you can notice that aliases can be used for embedded fields like `votes` & `favs`.

Moreover, `graphql-compose-mongoose` re-implements alias logic to make alias support in resolvers with `lean: true` option (when graphql get raw documents from the database).

[Issue #273](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/273)

## Performance improvements

### Added projection for nested embedded documents

Before v9.0.0, it was supported projection only for top-level fields. But now `graphql-compose-mongoose` support projection for embedded (nested) fields. It helps reduce data transfer between MongoDB and GraphQL server.

[Issue #273](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/273)

### Added new `dataLoader` & `dataLoaderMany` resolvers

These resolvers are helpful for relations construction between Entities for avoiding the N+1 Problem via [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader). This problem occurs when a client requests an array of records with some relation data:
- GraphQL call first resolve method with 1 query for getting a list of records
- and for every record will call nested resolve methods which make separate DB requests

As you can expect, doing N+1 queries will flood your database with queries, which is something we can and should avoid. So `dataLoader`, `dataLoaderMany` resolvers make one batch request for getting all related records by id.

```ts
import { schemaComposer } from 'graphql-compose';
import { composeMongoose } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';
import { mongoose, Document } from 'mongoose';

mongoose.set('debug', true); // <-- show mongoose queries in console

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
});
const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  authorId: { type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId },
  reviewerIds: { type: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId] },
});

interface IUser extends Document {
  name: string;
}

interface IPost extends Document {
  title: string;
  authorId?: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  reviewerIds?: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId];
}

const UserModel = mongoose.model<IUser>('User', UserSchema);
const PostModel = mongoose.model<IPost>('Post', PostSchema);

const UserTC = composeMongoose(UserModel);
const PostTC = composeMongoose(PostModel);

PostTC.addRelation('author', {
  // resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findById({ lean: true }),
  resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoader({ lean: true }),
  prepareArgs: {
    _id: (s) => s.authorId,
  },
  projection: { authorId: true },
});

PostTC.addRelation('reviewers', {
  // resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findByIds({ lean: true }),
  resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoaderMany({ lean: true }),
  prepareArgs: {
    _ids: (s) => s.reviewerIds,
  },
  projection: { reviewerIds: true },
});

schemaComposer.Query.addFields({
  posts: PostTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany(),
});

// console.log(schemaComposer.toSDL());
export const schema = schemaComposer.buildSchema();
```

Test suite for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/blob/master/src/__tests__/github_issues/260-test.ts).

### Add `lean: boolean` option to query resolvers

Resolvers with `lean: true` is significantly faster than without it (anywhere from 3 - 10 times faster). If you need just `raw` data from DB then use this option. By default queries return fully instantiated Mongoose documents for supporting mongoose's `virtuals` fields, plugins and model methods (but it consume much more CPU & RAM).

`lean` option available in the following resolvers `findById`, `findByIds`, `findMany`, `findOne`, `dataLoader`, `dataLoaderMany`.

BTW mongoose `aliases` are supported with `lean: true` option. graphql-compose-mongoose takes care about their proper conversion in filters, projection and output results:

```ts
// With aliases in MongoDB you will have such records
//   { _id: '...', n: 'John', a: 26 }
const AuthorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, alias: 'n' },
  score: { type: Number, alias: 's' },
});
const AuthorModel = mongoose.model<IAuthor>('Author', AuthorSchema);

// Will be generate graphql type with full field names
//   type Author { name: String, score: Float }
const AuthorTC = composeMongoose(AuthorModel, { schemaComposer });

// Resolver will send queries something like that:
//   db.author.find({ n: 'John' })
// And convert shortened raw records to full form
//   { _id: '...', n: 'John', s: 26 }
const userFindManyResolver = AuthorTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({ lean: true });
```

- feat add `lean: true` option #259, #266 [commit](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/commit/321dded4e2b346e5ab3d549a6bc5b31458478fd1)

## Breaking changes

### In resolver `updateById` was changed its input args

From `UpdateByIdRecord` input type was extracted `_id` field on top level.

```diff
- updateById(record: UpdateByIdRecord!)
+ updateById(_id: MongoID!, record: UpdateByIdRecord!)
```

[Issue #257](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/257)

### `createMany` resolver now validates all records before save

Before 9.0.0 graphql-compose-mongoose may save some records provided to `createMany` even some other fail with a validation error. Now it firstly will check that all records are valid, and if some records contain errors, then no one document will be saved.

### Some generated types were renamed

- type for `filter._operators` field. Was `OperatorsXXXFilterInput` became `XXXFilterOperatorsInput`. It helps to keep all generated types with the same prefix for `XXX` entity.
- in resolver `count` was changed `filter` type name from `Filter` to `FilterCount`. All rest resolvers already had `FilterFindMany`, `FilterFinOne`, etc. names, and only `count` resolver does not follow this pattern.

## Misc

- Refactor `pagination` & `connection` resolvers (now they are as dependencies) [#272](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/272)
- Allow to provide `suffixes` for resolvers configs [#268](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/268)
- Remove `getRecordIdFn()` [#262](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/262)
- TypeScript definition improvements for resolvers: `source` is now typed, and first level of available `args` in resolvers
